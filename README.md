# Larch Intro UKCH

The examples were created using python 3.6 and Larch 0.9.47

These files are part of a tutorial for using Larch at UK Catalysis Hub.

The examples follow Bruce Ravel's demonstration given at Diamon Light Source. 
This first part of the demonstration is presented both as a jupyter notebook (XAFS_Processing_1.ipynb) and as a script (xafs_processing_101.py). 
The second part of the demonstration is in the second notebook (XAFS_Processing_2.ipynb) with its corresponding script file
