# Larch Intro UKCH

The examples were created using python 3.6 and Larch 0.9.47

These files are part of a tutorial for using Larch at UK Catalysis Hub.

The first example follows the Bruce Ravel's demonstration given at Diamon Light Source.

The first part is presented both as a jupyter notebook (XAFS_Processing_101.ipynb) and as a script (xafs_processing_101.py).
